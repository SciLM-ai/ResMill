# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-31)

### Added

- `resmill.structure`: composable structural deformation fields
  (`anticline`, `syncline`, `dome`, `ramp`, `fault`, `surface`), vertical
  shifts in meters, positive down; plain callables, 2-D arrays, and
  scalars are accepted anywhere a `Structure` is.
- `to_grdecl()` (also as `Layer.to_grdecl` / `Reservoir.to_grdecl`):
  self-contained Petrel/Eclipse corner-point export (SPECGRID, COORD,
  ZCORN, ACTNUM, PORO, PERMX, PERMY, PERMZ, optional FACIES) with
  `top=`/`base=` conforming (drape or proportional squeeze),
  `erode_above=`/`erode_below=` truncation with ACTNUM, per-layer
  structure lists stitched with a younger-truncates-older rule (angular
  unconformities), and PERMZ from each layer's `kzkx`.
- `plot_section()`: true-depth cross-sections of the deformed grid.
- `to_pyvista()`: `pyvista.ExplicitStructuredGrid` for interactive 3-D QC
  (new `viz` extra).

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `Reservoir` now concatenates `poro_mat`/`perm_mat`/`active`
  with the deepest layer first, so stacked arrays follow the documented
  per-layer convention (k index increases upward) and stacked
  cross-sections from `plot_slices`/`plot_cube_slices` render the layer
  order correctly. Previously the top layer occupied global k=0..nz-1 and
  a stacked section drew the reservoir upside down. Code that indexed
  `Reservoir` arrays along k must be updated; `Reservoir.layers` and
  `Reservoir.zz` keep the listed top-to-bottom order.
- `__version__` now matches the packaged version (was 0.1.2 while
  pyproject said 0.1.3).

## 0.1.3 (2026-08-30)

- Moved the repository to the SciLM-ai org, added the PyPI
  trusted-publishing workflow.

## 0.1.2

- LICENSE copyright set to the authors; first PyPI release line.
